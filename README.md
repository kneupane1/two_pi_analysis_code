# two_pi_analysis_code

Here is the analysis code that is used to analyse two pi data. As an input files after the converter are used. As an output root file with multi dim hists is created

17feb17 - new electron selection, new files norm_nphe_27jan17_aft_cc_match_gt50.root and phel_integr_fract_22jan17.txt. New proton energy loss is added for data and sim. Electron correction is added for sim.

13apr17 - new hadron id + new fid cuts for all particles, including th_vs_p + z-vertex cuts

15mar19 - adjusted pim fid and exclusivity cuts for both topologies in order to avoid accidental fluctuations in the single-differential distributions.
